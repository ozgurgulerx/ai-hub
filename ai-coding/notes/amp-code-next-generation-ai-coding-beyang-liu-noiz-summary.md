Status: **To verify**

## Agent Architecture and Performance (Claims)

- Amp is described as an “opinionated coding agent” positioned like a research lab “one year in the future” exploring agent-driven development. [Unverified]
- The system is described as having two modes:
  - **Smart agent**: uses all sub-agents for complex tasks (slower). [Unverified]
  - **Rush agent**: faster for in-the-loop edits. [Unverified]
- An “Oracle” sub-agent is described as handling deep reasoning separately to preserve the main agent’s responsiveness and tool variety. [Unverified]

## Specialized Sub-Agents (Claims)

- Four specialized sub-agents are described:
  - **Finder**: discovers context using a small, quick model. [Unverified]
  - **Oracle**: deep reasoning for debugging. [Unverified]
  - **Librarian**: fetches library/framework context. [Unverified]
  - **Kraken**: large-scale refactors. [Unverified]

## Developer Experience (Claims)

- The terminal UI is described as streaming diffs and CLI commands, and connecting to editors (Emacs/Neovim/JetBrains) to collect diagnostics with high information density. [Unverified]
- A custom review interface is described as including an editable diff viewer with full navigation plus a “tour of changes” that guides developers through files in priority order. [Unverified]

## Business Model (Claims)

- A built-in mini ad network is described as delivering subtle developer tool ads in terminal/editor to sponsor Rush agent inference, improving accessibility for side projects and broader adoption. [Unverified]
