Status: **To verify**

## Efficiency and Performance (Claims)

- Cursor Composer is described as using agent-based LLM technology with ~4× more efficient token generation, offering faster speed than summer 2023-era models. [Unverified]
- A “Cheetah” model inside Composer is described as delivering fast + smart agent capabilities inspired by Cursor Tab while maintaining efficiency. [Unverified]

## Training and Infrastructure (Claims)

- RL training is described as using parallel tool calling and a mixture-of-experts model to improve scoring and parameter updates. [Unverified]
- Infra is described as including a PyTorch trainer, Ray inference server, and microVMs. [Unverified]
- Low-precision training is described as achieving ~3.5× speedup on Blackwell chips (hardware claim). [Unverified]

## User Experience and Feedback (Claims)

- In the first week, performance gains are described as aligning with log-scale compute input, improving token generation speed and UX. [Unverified]
- Users are described as responding positively to speed + intelligence, enabling a different coding experience via faster code generation and understanding. [Unverified]
