## Intelligence as a Commodity (Thesis)

- Intelligence is framed as commoditizing: near-zero-cost, instant access to public information (e.g., coding, personal health), increasing the relative value of private/insider knowledge. [Unverified]

## The “Jagged Edge of Intelligence”

- The “jagged edge” concept explains uneven progress across tasks: improvement rates vary by task properties and ease of verification. [Unverified]
- Digital tasks are described as progressing faster due to faster iteration and abundant data. [Unverified]

## Verifier’s Law (Verification Drives Capability)

- “Verifier’s Law” is described as: AI capability on a task is proportional to how easily the task can be verified. [Unverified]
- Easily verifiable tasks (example: Sudoku) are framed as being automated sooner. [Unverified]

## Verification Asymmetry + How to Reduce It

- Verification asymmetry is highlighted for tasks like code, competition math, and factual essays. [Unverified]
- Proposed lever: privileged information (answer keys, test cases) reduces verification difficulty. [Unverified]
- Alpha Evolve is referenced as an example of leveraging verification asymmetry with sampling + algorithms for hard-but-verifiable tasks (math, compute optimization). [Unverified]

## Agents Era + Task-Specific Compute

- The “agents era” is framed as enabling frictionless, personalized access to knowledge across domains. [Unverified]
- Decreasing intelligence costs are framed as persisting via adaptive compute that allocates resources per task. [Unverified]
