## Appendix: Raw Notes (Preserved)

> “A question to my readers. Instead of a (targeted) reading time of 12-14 mins per article, I end up writing articles twice that size. No matter how many hours & days, I spend trimming my article, I can’t seem to bring it below that threshold. Any suggestions? For e.g., in this article are there portions that are irrelevant?”
