# MCP Server Design for LLMs (not humans) — Noiz Summary Notes

Source video (YouTube): `https://youtu.be/eeOANluSqAE`

This note distills claims from a **Noiz** YouTube summary provided in the prompt. Treat prescriptions as **to verify** until corroborated by primary sources (talk recording, docs, or strong field evidence).

## Core claim (as described)

MCP servers should be designed for **LLMs as the primary “client”**, not for human developers reading API docs.

## Tool surface design (claims)

- Expose only essential tools; too many options overwhelm models and degrade tool selection.
- Tool descriptions should be direct, structured, and example-rich (unlike human-facing API docs).

## Prefer purpose-built tools over generic primitives (claims)

- Provide tools aligned to real tasks (example: database migrations) rather than generic “Run SQL” tools that require too much implicit context and increase error risk.

## Evaluation and testing (claims)

- Evals/tests are described as crucial to ensure LLMs can use tools correctly given non-deterministic behavior.

## Anti-pattern: autogenerated MCP servers from APIs (claims)

- Autogenerating MCP servers from existing APIs is described as ineffective because it:
  - exposes too many tools
  - lacks the context/examples LLMs need
