## Deployment Barriers (Claims)

- In 2025, agents are described as being constrained more by deployment barriers than by intelligence limits. Blockers cited include: lack of connectors to external data sources, limited generalizability beyond specific tools, complex agent creation processes, and high operational costs for long inference jobs + ensembling. [Unverified]
- Agent operational cost (long inference jobs, ensembling) is described as prohibitive for mainstream adoption, though decreasing via distillation, inference/hardware optimization, and competitive pricing among large providers. [Unverified]
- Agents are described as needing a robust ecosystem of tools/connections to do valuable work—analogous to a smart person at a desk without data access. [Unverified]

## Market Reality (Claims)

- Despite multiple launches from OpenAI (Operator, Deep Research, Responses API, o3, Codex, ChatGPT Agent) in Jan–Jul 2025, agents are described as not mainstream, with use cases concentrated in deep research and coding. [Unverified]
- Usage is described as “exploding” when agents start working effectively (Deep Research and coding agents cited), implying demand exists and the primary barrier is deployment. [Unverified]

## Future Vision (Claims)

- A possible future is described as personal AI systems for individuals, context-aware AIs at the center of businesses, and millions of mini agents filling gaps. [Unverified]
- Connection to any data source and generalization to new environments are described as key assets across domains. [Unverified]
