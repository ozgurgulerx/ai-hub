Status: **To verify**

## Enterprise Model-Provider Dynamics (Claims)

- OpenAI enterprise API market share is described as falling (50% → 25% mid-2025), while Anthropic is described as rising (12% → 32%). [Unverified]
- Anthropic is described as reaching $1B+ revenue fastest and scaling valuation rapidly. [Unverified]
- Amazon is described as investing heavily in training chips for Anthropic and scaling compute aggressively. [Unverified]

## Moats by Stack Layer (Claims)

- The model layer is described as harder to build than the app layer and capturing more value net of competition. [Unverified]
- Claude Code is described as maintaining premium pricing due to model quality differentiation in coding. [Unverified]

## Enterprise Search: “Hard Parts” as a Moat (Glean) (Claims)

- Glean’s moat is described as coming from enterprise search ranking challenges (low query volume, freshness, long tail), not from adding LLMs. [Unverified]
- A Chrome extension is described as replacing native search bars and teaching users to route work through Glean. [Unverified]

## PLG vs Enterprise Sales (OpenRouter vs Glean) (Claims)

- OpenRouter is described as winning via PLG/self-serve with detailed provider insights (quality/latency/throughput) as defensible advantages. [Unverified]
- Enterprise “rip and replace” is described as hard; Glean is described as succeeding via top-down enterprise sales with expand/contract dynamics. [Unverified]

## Emerging Architectures and Cost (Claims)

- Diffusion models are described as achieving 80–90% quality at ~1/10 cost and latency of transformers, particularly suited for code reasoning due to bidirectional dependencies. [Unverified]
- MCP is described as becoming the de facto interoperability standard due to specification quality and backing. [Unverified]
