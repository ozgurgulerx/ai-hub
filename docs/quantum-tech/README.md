# Quantum Tech

This module tracks notes, references, and planned write-ups on quantum technologies (computing, networking, and sensing).

## What this should cover

- Fundamentals: qubits, measurement, entanglement, noise
- Hardware modalities: superconducting, ions, neutral atoms, photonics, spin qubits
- Quantum software stack: circuits → compilers → control stack → execution
- Algorithms: canonical + NISQ + hybrid workflows; credible use cases
- Error correction: surface codes, resource estimation, FTQC roadmaps
- Benchmarks: avoiding misleading metrics; “useful work” framing
- Quantum networking + cryptography: QKD, repeaters, PQC migration
- Quantum sensing + metrology: clocks, imaging, navigation, geology
