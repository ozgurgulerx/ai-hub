# AI Funding Trends (2025) — Crunchbase Charts Summary (Gené Teare, Dec 16, 2025)

This note distills an article excerpt provided in the prompt (“6 Charts That Show The Big AI Funding Trends Of 2025”, Gené Teare, Dec 16, 2025). No URL was provided; treat this as **secondary notes** until the primary source is pinned.

## Key data points (claims; attributed to Crunchbase unless noted)

### AI funding share and growth

- AI captured **~50%** of global startup funding in **2025**, up from **34%** in 2024.
- **$202.3B** invested in AI in **2025 so far**, spanning infrastructure, foundation labs, and applications.
- AI funding increased **>75% YoY** versus **$114B** invested in 2024.

### Foundation labs take a larger slice

- Foundation model companies raised **$80B** in **2025 to date**, described as **40%** of global AI funding.
- Model-company funding more than doubled versus **$31B** in 2024 (described as ~27% of AI funding).
- OpenAI + Anthropic are described as capturing **14% of global venture investment** in 2025.
- One 2026 question raised: whether model developers continue raising tens of billions in equity for compute, or partnerships close the gap.
- Hyperscaler capex is described as **$300B+** in 2025, with increased commitments for 2026.

### Concentration and geography

- The U.S. received **$159B** of AI funding in 2025, described as **79%** of AI funding.
- San Francisco Bay Area raised **$122B**, described as more than three quarters of U.S. AI funding.
- In AI, **58%** of funding was in “megarounds” of **$500M+**.

### Who leads rounds (PE vs VC vs corporates)

- Corporate investors are described as leading billion-dollar rounds (named: Meta, SpaceX, Nvidia, Intercontinental Exchange, ASML, The Walt Disney Co., Google).
- Despite corporate involvement, private equity / alternative investors are described as dominating by dollars for single-lead rounds:
  - PE-led sole-lead deals: **$63B** across ~**300** rounds (≥$1M) in 2025.
  - VC-led sole-lead deals: **$38B** across **1,600** fundings (≥$1M) in 2025.
  - VC is described as leading **75%** of deals analyzed (activity, not dollars).
- Examples cited:
  - SoftBank led a **$40B** investment into OpenAI.
  - Meta led a **$14.3B** investment into Scale AI, with ~10 key team members leaving to join Meta (including CEO Alexandr Wang).
  - Venture firms cited as leading billion-dollar AI deals in 2025: Lightspeed Venture Partners, Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz.

### Market sizing (Menlo Ventures report; claim)

- Enterprise AI revenue in 2025 is described as **$37B**, up **>3× YoY**:
  - **$19B** user-facing products
  - **$18B** AI infrastructure

### Private-market concentration (valuation; claim)

- OpenAI is described as valued at **$500B**.
- Anthropic is described as valued at **$183B**.
- Together, they are described as comprising close to **10%** of the value on the Crunchbase Unicorn Board.

## What this suggests (inferences; treat cautiously)

- Funding is described as both **AI-heavy** and **top-heavy** (megarounds concentrate capital).
- The “compute economy” (hyperscaler capex + model-lab financing) increasingly shapes venture outcomes for the rest of the stack.

## Practical implications for “AI startup patterns” (inferences)

- Category strategy matters: infrastructure and foundation labs may compete for disproportionate capital vs. typical SaaS benchmarks.
- If capital concentrates, distribution and defensibility may matter more than “incremental model lift” in the long tail of apps.

## Verification checklist (to pin the primary source)

- Add the article URL and confirm the denominators for:
  - “AI captured ~50% of global funding” (what counts as AI; what counts as global funding)
  - “14% of global venture investment” (scope, time window)
  - valuation figures and Unicorn Board calculations
- Confirm the Menlo Ventures report citation and methodology for the $37B revenue estimate.
