# AI Governance

Operating model that turns **responsible AI principles** into **enforceable controls**: roles, policies, risk management, evaluation gates, monitoring, incident response.

## Lifecycle: Govern → Map → Measure → Manage

### Govern
Define roles, responsibilities, and policies (fairness, reliability, privacy, transparency, accountability)

### Map
Identify risks: impact assessments, threat modeling, AI red teaming

### Measure
Evaluate risks: content safety, groundedness, safety mitigation, reliability

### Manage
Operationalize: monitoring, change management, incident response, compliance
