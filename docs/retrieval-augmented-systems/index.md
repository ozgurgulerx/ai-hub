# RAG & Retrieval Systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds LLM outputs in retrieved evidence. This section covers the full RAG stack.

- Data quality and document ingestion
- Chunking strategies
- Embedding selection and fine-tuning
- Retrieval architectures (sparse, dense, hybrid)
- Reranking
- GraphRAG and knowledge graphs
- Context engineering
- Evaluation and production operations
- Security considerations

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Chunking** | Breaking documents into retrievable units |
| **Embeddings** | Dense vector representations for semantic search |
| **Hybrid Search** | Combining sparse (BM25) and dense retrieval |
| **Reranking** | Second-stage scoring for precision |
| **GraphRAG** | Graph-augmented retrieval for multi-hop reasoning |
| **Context Engineering** | Managing what goes into the LLM context window |
