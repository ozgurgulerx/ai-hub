## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Outcome-First** | Design evals from business outcomes, not abstract metrics |
| **Custom Scoring** | Generic metrics don't work; tailor to your application |
| **Continuous Ops** | Evals evolve with the system, not one-time benchmarks |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | Automation alone is insufficient for evaluation |
