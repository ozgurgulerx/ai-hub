Best practices and patterns for using AI assistants to write, review, and maintain code.

## Start Here

**[AI Coding Comprehensive Guide](AI-coding-comprehensive-guide.md)** — Complete reference covering:

- Agent architecture patterns (sub-agents, parallel processing)
- Retrieval for coding agents (when RAG helps vs hurts)
- Testing and verification strategies
- Code review evolution
- Workflow patterns (Claude Code, Cursor)
- Production realities and adoption risks

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Plan→Act** | Structured workflow: gather context, plan, then implement |
| **TDD with Agents** | Test-driven development grounds agent output |
| **Compaction** | Summarizing context for long-running tasks |
| **Skills** | Reusable bundles of templates/code/instructions |
