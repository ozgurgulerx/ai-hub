## 🚀 Quick Start

Pick a guide based on what you're building:

!!! tip "Building RAG systems?"
    Start with the [RAG Comprehensive Guide](retrieval-augmented-systems/notes/RAG-comprehensive-guide.md)

!!! tip "Building agents?"
    Start with the [Agents Guide](agents/notes/agents-comprehensive-guide.md) and [MCP Guide](agents/agent-protocols/mcp/MCP-comprehensive-guide.md)

!!! tip "Evaluating AI systems?"
    Start with the [EvalOps Guide](evalops/notes/evalops-comprehensive-guide.md)

## 📝 Note Status

Most notes are labeled with verification status:

- **Verified** — Cross-checked against primary sources
- **To verify** — Sourced from transcripts/summaries, awaiting verification

Always verify claims before relying on them for production decisions.
