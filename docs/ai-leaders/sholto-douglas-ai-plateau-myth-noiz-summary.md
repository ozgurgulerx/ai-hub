Status: **To verify**

This file captures **claims and theses** attributed to the talk summary. Treat benchmark numbers, timelines, and causal explanations as unverified until checked against the recording.

## Claims About Capability Progress

- RL on LLMs is described as “finally working” in 2024 and enabling long autonomous coding sessions via self-correction and memory systems. [Unverified]
- Sonnet 4.5 is described as a top coding agent with a SWE-bench step up (72 → 78 cited). [Unverified]
- Models are described as improving long-horizon coherence via taste/context/memory management and learning from experience. [Unverified]
- A shift from pre-training dominance to RL is framed as producing reasoning behaviors like confidence assessment and saying “I don’t know”. [Unverified]

## Research Strategy / Methodology Theses

- Coding is framed as the fastest path to economic impact and to AI-assisted AI research (coding as a bottleneck). [Unverified]
- A benchmark (“meter evals”) is referenced as correlating progress with longer time horizons; capabilities described as doubling every few months. [Unverified]
- “Scale washes away tweaks”: the bitter-lesson framing that scaling compute + RL outperforms clever priors over time. [Unverified]
- Test-time compute + RL are framed as letting models solve harder problems than “off the cuff”, with distillation feeding improvements back into weights. [Unverified]
- Training pipelines are described as brittle (“duct tape”) with room for engineering improvement while still showing smooth progress via many stacked techniques. [Unverified]

## Industry / Organizational Theses

- Anthropic culture is described as uniquely oriented around articulated theories of impact, and as investing in growing junior talent. [Unverified]
- A positioning contrast is suggested (Anthropic → coding/computer use; others → math/science reasoning focus). [Unverified]
- AGI timeline claim: 2–3 years with sufficient compute/feedback loops/effort. [Unverified]

## Product / Market Implications

- Individuals managing teams of always-on agents is framed as imminent (10–100× leverage). [Unverified]
- Policymakers are urged to track progress on real economic tasks due to rapid advancement and societal impact. [Unverified]
