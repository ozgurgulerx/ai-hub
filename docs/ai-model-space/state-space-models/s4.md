# S4 (Structured State Space Models)

S4 is a foundational family of **structured state space models** that made deep SSMs practical for long-range sequence modeling.

## What it is

- Uses structured parameterizations of state dynamics to enable efficient computation.
- Provides much of the conceptual lineage behind later high-performance SSM families.

## When it’s useful

- Learning the “core” modern SSM ideas (stability, discretization, structured kernels)
- Long sequences in domains like audio, time-series, and other continuous/temporal signals
