# Sakana CTM

Continuous Thought Machines — temporal reasoning architecture from Sakana AI.

## Core Innovation

- **Neuron-level models (NLM)** — activations from finite history
- **Synchronization via dot products** — diverse firing time scales
- **Adaptive computation time** — easy examples solve faster

## Key Claims

- Step-by-step maze navigation with backtracking
- Multi-hierarchical temporal representations
- Self-bootstrapping training mechanism

## Research Direction

Alternative to Transformers for reasoning tasks requiring exploration and correction.
