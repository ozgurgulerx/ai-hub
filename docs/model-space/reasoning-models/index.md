# Reasoning Models

Large language models that exhibit reasoning behavior: multi-step problem solving, structured deliberation, and tool use.

**[Reasoning Models Comprehensive Guide](../reasoning-models-comprehensive-guide.md)** — Complete reference covering:

- Chain-of-thought and RL for reasoning
- Verifier's Law (capability ∝ verification ease)
- Jagged edge of intelligence
- Self-teaching and IO fine-tuning
- Scaling and emergence
- Long-running agents and compaction
- Automating discovery limitations

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Verifier's Law** | AI capability on a task is proportional to verification ease |
| **Jagged Intelligence** | Uneven progress—strong in some areas, weak in others |
| **Self-Consistency** | Sample multiple paths, majority vote improves accuracy |
| **Compaction** | Summarization enables long-running reasoning workflows |
