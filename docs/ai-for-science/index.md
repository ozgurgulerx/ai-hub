# AI for Science

Applying AI to scientific discovery and engineering.

## Topics

- **Protein Structure** — AlphaFold, structure prediction
- **Drug Discovery** — Molecular generation, binding prediction
- **Materials Science** — Property prediction, inverse design
- **Climate & Weather** — Forecasting, simulation
- **Mathematics** — Theorem proving, conjecture generation

## Key Breakthroughs

| System | Domain | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **AlphaFold** | Protein structure | Solved 50-year grand challenge |
| **AlphaFold 3** | Molecular complexes | Proteins + DNA/RNA/ligands |
| **GraphCast** | Weather | 10-day forecasts in minutes |
| **GNoME** | Materials | 2.2M new stable crystals |

## What Changed

- **Speed** — Years of compute → minutes
- **Accuracy** — Competitive with experimental methods
- **Scale** — Millions of predictions vs thousands
- **Accessibility** — Open models and databases
