# Multi-Agent Systems

This folder collects patterns, notes, and practical references for building systems with **multiple cooperating agents** (orchestrators + specialists), including delegation, verification, and human-in-the-loop workflows.

## In This Repo

- Multi-agent orchestration examples live under `../02-af-getting-started-workflows/` (concurrent, group chat, handoff, sequential, etc.).
- A2A protocol patterns: `../agent-protocols/a2a/README.md`
- Governance controls (identity, approvals, logging, kill switches): `../../../ai-security-and-governance/docs/agent-governance/README.md`

## Notes (Claims to Verify)

- UX/design principles for semi-autonomous multi-agent systems (BlenderLM, AutoGen Studio): `../notes/multi-agent-system-design-principles-blenderlm-autogenstudio-noiz-summary.md`
- Agentic AI and workflows (Andrew Ng): `../notes/agentic-ai-and-workflows-andrew-ng-noiz-summary.md`
- Building more effective agents (Claude; multi-agent vs sequential framing): `../notes/building-more-effective-ai-agents-claude-noiz-summary.md`
