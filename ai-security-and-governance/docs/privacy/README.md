# Privacy-Preserving ML

This folder collects practical notes on **privacy-preserving training and analytics** for AI systems.

## Chapters

- **Differential privacy (DP)**: `differential-privacy.md` (privacy guarantees for training, analytics, and data release)
- **Federated learning (FL)**: `federated-learning.md` (train across silos/devices without centralizing raw data)

## How to use

- If you're deciding whether to use FL/DP: start with the “When to use / when not to” sections.
- If you're implementing: jump to the “Design checklist” and “Pitfalls” sections.
