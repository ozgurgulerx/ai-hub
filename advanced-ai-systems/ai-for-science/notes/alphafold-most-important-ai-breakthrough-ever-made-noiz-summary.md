Status: **To verify**

## Transformative Impact on Protein Structure Prediction (Claims)

- AlphaFold is described as compressing protein structure determination from ~1 year and ~$100k per protein down to 5–10 minutes, with accuracy comparable to experimental methods. [Unverified]
- AlphaFold is described as enabling ~200M protein structure predictions across sequenced genomes. [Unverified]

## Confidence and Limitations (Claims)

- The system is described as producing calibrated confidence scores with an average of ~0.9 on the LDDT scale. [Unverified]
- High-confidence predictions are described as still sometimes missing relevant protein states or being incorrect, requiring researchers to understand limitations in biological contexts. [Unverified]

## Protein Design Workflow Shift (Claims)

- “AlphaFold filters” are described as becoming dominant in modern protein design workflows, improving success rates even for unnatural engineered proteins. [Unverified]

## Scale-Enabled Discovery (Claims)

- AlphaFold is described as enabling science that requires thousands of predictions at scale, including discovering essential protein interactions (fertilization example mentioned). [Unverified]

## Disorder Signals via Low-Confidence Regions (Claims)

- AlphaFold is described as surfacing protein disorder insights (absent from experimental structure databases) via low-confidence regions. [Unverified]

## Adoption (Claims)

- AlphaFold is described as being used by ~3 million scientists daily for drug development and biological understanding. [Unverified]
