## Graph-Based Legal Analysis

- Knowledge graphs are presented as a way to run **mass analytics** over connected legal data via node-to-node and multi-hop analyses.
- Structured representations of relationships between **clauses, documents, entities, and parties** are described as important for improving agent accuracy/reliability in legal workflows.

## Multi-Agent Systems + Retrieval

- Multi-agent legal workflows are described as decomposing work into steps with different requirements/frequency/state, with graphs used to support **probabilistic and structured reasoning**.
- Graph-based information retrieval is described as enabling both visual and natural-language analysis over large datasets to support expert decision-making on signals/cases.

## Iterative Improvement + Case Detection

- Graph schemas are described as being iteratively built/pruned/updated to improve report quality and align with lawyer preferences.
- Graph-based analysis of complaints/lawsuits is described as enabling earlier detection of mass cases/class actions.
