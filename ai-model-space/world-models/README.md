# World Models

This folder covers **world models** for embodied AI and planning: learned simulators that predict future states from observations and actions, enabling lookahead and control.

## Suggested Structure (Planned)

- `notes/` — distilled talk/paper summaries (label **To verify** when sourced from transcripts)
- `experiments/` — small reproductions or planning demos (if/when added)
- `references/` — primary papers and repos

## Notes

- World models on an academic budget (Nicklas Hansen; Noiz summary, to verify): `../../docs/ai-model-space/world-models/notes/world-models-on-an-academic-budget-nicklas-hansen-noiz-summary.md`
- From seeing to doing: spatial intelligence → embodied agents (Fei-Fei Li; Noiz summary, to verify): `../../docs/ai-model-space/world-models/notes/from-seeing-to-doing-fei-fei-li-neurips-noiz-summary.md`
