Status: **To verify**

## Company Building and Growth (Claims)

- Surge AI is described as reaching $1B revenue in under 4 years with fewer than 100 employees and being bootstrapped. [Unverified]
- A contrarian GTM stance is described: minimal social promotion and rejecting VC funding, attracting customers that value “data quality” and provide feedback. [Unverified]
- Surge AI is described as operating more like a research lab with long-term incentives and intellectual rigor. [Unverified]

## Data Quality Thesis (Claims)

- Surge AI frames its work as teaching models “taste” and subtle notions of quality beyond checkbox labeling (e.g., uniqueness, imagery, emotional impact in creative tasks). [Unverified]
- Expert human evaluation is framed as a better progress measure than noisy benchmarks or casual A/B tests. [Unverified]

## Benchmarks and Evaluation Problems (Claims)

- Benchmarks are described as often flawed (wrong answers, messy data), enabling hill-climbing without solving real-world messy problems. [Unverified]
- Leaderboards like LM Arena are criticized as incentivizing flashy responses and hallucinations due to skim-based voting dynamics. [Unverified]

## Reinforcement Learning Environments (Claims)

- RL environments that simulate real-world scenarios (tools, objectives, interacting entities, multi-turn) are described as increasingly important for training. [Unverified]
- Trajectories (including failures and inefficient paths) are described as valuable training signals beyond final answers. [Unverified]

## Progress and Timelines (Claims)

- A claim is made that reaching very high reliability (e.g., 99% → 99.9%) takes much longer than automating large fractions of tasks, implying a long road to “AGI”. [Unverified]
- Future models are predicted to differentiate by the “values” and objective functions of labs shaping model behavior/personality. [Unverified]

## Products Mentioned (Claims)

- Surge AI is described as offering human data products including rubrics, verifiers, preference data, and RL environments, and measuring progress via many signals across workers/projects/tasks. [Unverified]
