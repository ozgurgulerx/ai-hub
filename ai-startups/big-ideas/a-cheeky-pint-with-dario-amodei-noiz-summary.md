Status: **To verify**

- **Idea**: AI model businesses are not commodities; models have differentiated behavior/personality and can be sticky. [Unverified]
- **Why now**: Rapid capability improvements and fast-growing demand are changing market structure (clouds vs labs vs platforms). [Unverified]
- **What changes**: Platform-first labs may build direct distribution to users and compete across stack layers; model generations require upfront investment with step-function returns. [Unverified]
- **What has to be true**: Differentiation persists and is visible to customers; reliability and safety improve enough for expanded use cases. [Inference]
- **Failure modes**: Regulation missteps, safety incidents, data constraints (“data wall”), and talent constraints slow progress or shift market power. [Unverified]
- **Signals to watch**: Pricing moves, distribution channels, enterprise adoption patterns, and safety/regulatory posture. [Inference]
- **Startups**: (Add startups that embody these theses.) [Inference]
