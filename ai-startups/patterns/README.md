# AI Startup Patterns

This folder captures **repeatable patterns** shaping the AI startup landscape (funding, go-to-market motions, stack “layers”, and recurring failure modes).

Each note should:
- be **source-linked** (or explicitly “source missing”)
- separate **claims** from **inferences**
- avoid turning one year’s data into timeless laws
