## Why AI Hub exists

Most AI learning resources are fragmented, tool-specific, overly academic, or disconnected from what actually ships. AI Hub is a curated, evolving knowledge base focused on how real AI systems are designed, built, deployed, secured, and improved — especially in production and enterprise contexts.

Think of it as:
- 📚 a learning hub
- 🧠 a mental model library
- 🧪 a workshop + lab companion
- 🛠️ a builder’s reference

## What you’ll learn here

### Core areas

- **LLM Builder Patterns**: what works in production, anti-patterns, failure modes
- **Context Engineering**: RAG, Hybrid RAG, GraphRAG, memory, grounding, retrieval trade-offs
- **Inference Engineering**: latency, cost, batching, model selection
- **Reasoning Models**: structured reasoning, verification, tool-augmented thinking
- **Agents & Orchestration**: tool use, memory, A2A topologies
- **Security & Governance**: network, data, model, safety by default
- **EvalOps & CostOps**: measure → iterate → win

## Azure AI Enablement Workshops

This repo also powers a 9-step end-to-end workshop series:

| Step | Focus | Outcome | Resources |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | LLM Builder Patterns | Systems that actually ship | [Workshop notes](workshops/01-llm-builder-patterns-that-actually-ship/README.md) |
| 2 | Context Engineering | Reliable grounding & retrieval | [Workshop notes](workshops/02-context-engineering-on-azure-rag-hybrid-graphrag/README.md) |
| 3 | Agents | Tools, memory, orchestration | [Workshop notes](workshops/03-agents-on-azure-ai-foundry-tools-memory-orchestration/README.md) |
| 4 | MCP | Model Context Protocol in practice | [Workshop notes](workshops/04-mcp-on-azure-ai-foundry/README.md) |
| 5 | A2A | Multi-agent coordination | [Workshop notes](workshops/05-agent-to-agent-topologies-and-negotiation-on-azure/README.md) |
| 6 | Interfaces | Web, voice, realtime | [Workshop notes](workshops/06-conversational-interfaces-web-voice-realtime/README.md) |
| 7 | Product & Design | AI design thinking | [Workshop notes](workshops/07-product-and-design-ai-design-thinking-hax-patterns/README.md) |
| 8 | Security | Governed by default | [Workshop notes](workshops/08-secure-and-governed-by-default/README.md) |
| 9 | EvalOps & CostOps | Measure & optimize | [Workshop notes](workshops/09-evalops-and-costops-measure-iterate-win/README.md) |

Each workshop includes clear mental models, practical examples, and implementation guidance.

## Who this is for

Built for AI engineers, solution architects, product engineers, founders, and technical PMs who want real systems, not toy demos.

---

## How to use this repo

1. Pick a capability (e.g., `retrieval-augmented-systems`).
2. Read the conceptual notes.
3. Follow linked examples or workshops.
4. Fork and adapt to your own use case.
5. Revisit as new material lands.

## Status & roadmap

- 🟢 Actively maintained
- 🧩 New modules added incrementally
- 🧠 Deeper inference & agent content coming
- 📈 Eval & benchmarking material expanding

Star ⭐️ to track progress.

## Philosophy

> AI systems are engineered, not prompted.

This repo prioritizes systems thinking, clarity over cleverness, and production reality over demos.
