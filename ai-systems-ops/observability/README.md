# AI Observability

Logging, tracing, and monitoring for AI systems in production.

## What This Covers

- **Structured logging**: prompt/response pairs, tool calls, latency
- **Tracing**: end-to-end request flows, agent decision trees
- **Metrics**: latency, throughput, error rates, cost tracking
- **Anomaly detection**: drift, unusual patterns, quality degradation
- **Privacy-aware logging**: redaction, retention policies, access controls

## Key Considerations

- Balance observability depth with privacy requirements
- Trace agent decision paths for debugging and audit
- Monitor model quality over time (not just latency/errors)
- Cost attribution per model/feature/user
