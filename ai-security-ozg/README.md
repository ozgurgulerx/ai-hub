AI security covers the ways AI systems can be attacked, misused, or fail, and the methods to reduce those risks. This includes:
- Adversarial and data poisoning attacks.
- Model theft, extraction, and inversion.
- Prompt injection and tool misuse.
- Privacy, data leakage, and sensitive information exposure.
- Robustness, monitoring, and incident response for AI systems.
- Governance, compliance, and secure deployment practices.
