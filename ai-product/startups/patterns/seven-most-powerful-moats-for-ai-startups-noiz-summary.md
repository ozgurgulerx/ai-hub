## Why Moats (Framing)

- Moats are framed as defensive strategies that prevent “infinite competition” driving margins to zero; a Peter Thiel quote (“competition is for losers”) is referenced. [Unverified]

## Early vs Post-PMF

- Speed is framed as the primary moat early. [Unverified]
- After product-market fit, additional moats are emphasized: process power, cornered resources, switching costs, counter positioning, network economies, and scale economies. [Unverified]

## AI-Specific Interpretations (As Described)

- **Process power**: hard-to-replicate processes (e.g., finely honed AI agents or deep software logic) that are difficult to copy. [Unverified]
- **Network economies**: data accumulation loops where more data enables better custom models, improving product performance (examples referenced: OpenAI, Cursor). [Unverified]
- **Scale economies**: training frontier models is expensive, so only a few can do it; they can then offer cheaper inference (example referenced: “DeepC” announcement). [Unverified]
- **Switching costs**: long onboarding and deep customization of agent logic create a new AI-native lock-in. [Unverified]
- **Counter positioning**: position as the opposite of an incumbent/competitor to build differentiation-driven defensibility. [Unverified]
- **Cornered resources**: patents, regulatory approvals, or specialized knowledge access. [Unverified]

## Business Dynamics (Cautions)

- Switching costs can come from customized workflows, long pilot cycles, and large contracts that make changing expensive. [Unverified]
- Workforce displacement: effective agents can reduce headcount needs; this may reduce revenue for service-based businesses (warning). [Unverified]
- Speed remains crucial when solving “existential pain” (urgent stakes, rapid change). [Unverified]
