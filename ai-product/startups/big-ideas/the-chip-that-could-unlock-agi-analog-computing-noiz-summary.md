## Energy Efficiency Crisis (Claims)

- Data centers are described as consuming a growing share of the energy grid (4% in 2025, potentially 8–10%), requiring massive new power. [Unverified]
- Human brain efficiency is contrasted (~20W). [Unverified]

## Analog Computing Thesis

- Analog computing is framed as using physics of the medium for computation, more efficient for stochastic, distributed intelligence than digital computers optimized for precise operations. [Unverified]
- Brains are framed as implementing dynamics physically with no abstraction; digital computers simulate time with numbers and lack inherent temporal dynamics. [Unverified]

## Technical Path (As Described)

- Transformers, diffusion models, and energy-based models are described as expressible as ODEs and mappable onto physical system dynamics for analog implementation. [Unverified]
- Embedding causality/time evolution into physics is framed as a basis for AGI (child-like causality learning analogy). [Unverified]

## Strategy

- “Unconventional AI” is described as targeting an intelligence paradigm within 5 years and scaling manufacturing (TSMC mentioned). [Unverified]
- Culture described as exploring existence proofs before engineering tradeoffs; full-stack integration from physics to algorithms emphasized. [Unverified]
