# Tools (optional scanners)

Day001 focuses on a **local attack harness** (`eval/harness/run_attack_pack.py`) so you have deterministic, CI-friendly tests.

If you also want external scanners:

- **garak**: broad LLM vulnerability probing
- **PyRIT**: structured red-teaming workflows

Install them in a dedicated virtualenv and wire them to your chosen model endpoint.
