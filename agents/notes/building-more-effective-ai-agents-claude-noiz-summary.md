## Agent Training and Capabilities (As Described)

- Claude’s agent training is described as focusing on open-ended, multi-step problems with tool use and environmental exploration, contributing to strong agent task performance. [Unverified]
- Coding skill is described as foundational for agent competence (search, planning, file creation), with complex coding training yielding broader task competence. [Unverified]

## Efficiency and Versatility (As Described)

- Code generation is described as faster than direct artifact creation, and useful in complex cases where direct creation is infeasible. [Unverified]
- Claude Code SDK is described as a general-purpose agent core for coding and other tasks, enabling a customizable agent loop with tools via MCP. [Unverified]

## Advanced Features and Multi-Agent Systems (As Described)

- “Skills” are described as reusable bundles (templates, code, assets) that help specialization and reuse across tasks. [Unverified]
- A multi-agent system is described as distinct from sequential workflows by enabling parallelized work across coding/search/test-time compute. [Unverified]
