## Agentic Workflows

- Agentic workflows are described as enabling iterative development with thinking/revision and multiple iterations, producing higher quality than linear approaches.
- Orchestration layers are described as managing multiple calls across models/clouds/services to build complex applications and boost productivity.
- “Agentic vision” is described as enabling image examination/interpretation and is positioned as valuable for PDF/document processing.

## AI-Assisted Coding + Data Engineering

- AI coding assistance is described as democratizing programming, enabling non-software engineers to steer AI to write code (broad claim).
- Document extraction is described as unlocking value by extracting critical information from forms and reports.
- GenAI is described as transforming data engineering by enabling processing of unstructured data (text/images/audio).

## Emerging Trends

- Voice interactions are described as gaining popularity relative to text.
- Decreasing “data gravity” is described as enabling easier cloud processing/analysis (verify framing).
- “Agentic data generation” is described as agents generating data to train models (trend claim).

## Visual AI + Autonomous Agents

- Visual AI is described as improving for image generation and document understanding (PDF analysis).
- Autonomous agents are described as becoming important in customer service and data engineering.
