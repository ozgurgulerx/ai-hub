## Business Model & Strategy (Claims)

- SurgeAI is described as bootstrapped and achieving >$1B revenue in 2022 while serving major labs; framing: build the vision before raising and don’t raise prematurely without knowing how to deploy capital. [Unverified]
- Differentiation is described as delivering data + insights (not “bodies”), using ML to measure annotator performance and output quality. [Unverified]

## Data Quality Crisis (Claims)

- Claim: 99% of 10–20M pieces of synthetic data gathered by customers were not useful; synthetic data alone is framed as insufficient. [Unverified]
- Human feedback is framed as a crucial external signal to align models to real objectives; models “think differently” and need validators. [Unverified]
- Human evaluation is framed as requiring careful fact-check/instruction-following/writing assessment; 5-second evals are framed as harmful (training “clickbait”). [Unverified]

## Technical Approaches (Scalable Oversight)

- “Scalable oversight” is framed as humans + models collaborating: editing model outputs, specialized interfaces, and complementary strengths. [Unverified]
- Building rich RL environments is described as requiring many consistent messages across channels with evolving time/events (complexity claim). [Unverified]
- SurgeAI is described as delivering preference data, verifiers, and failure-mode analysis to improve capabilities like coding. [Unverified]

## Quality Philosophy

- Quality data is framed as embracing human intelligence/creativity; scaling “mediocrity” happens when throwing humans at tasks without first-principles quality measurement. [Unverified]
- Quality is framed as domain-specific and subjective; requires technology to separate great from terrible outputs. [Unverified]

## Future Direction (Mix of Signals)

- Future training is framed as combining RL environments, expert reasoning traces, and high-quality human data; relying on one alone is framed as insufficient. [Unverified]
