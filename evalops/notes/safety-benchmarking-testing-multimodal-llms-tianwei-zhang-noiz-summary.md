## Safety Testing Infrastructure (As Described)

Four components are highlighted:
- High-quality diverse datasets (coverage)
- Metrics and criteria (definitions)
- Enhancement solutions (mitigations)
- An automated pipeline connecting these elements

## Automation + Human-in-the-Loop

- Automation alone is described as insufficient; HITL remains necessary in some evaluation cases.

## Threat Landscape (As Described)

- Three challenges highlighted: copyright/privacy violations, jailbreak attacks, and emerging threats.
- Solutions are described as combining technical measures (detection/prevention) with policy/regulatory measures.

## Measurement Challenge

- Defining good metrics is described as the hardest part and requires justification combining objective and subjective assessment.
