## Path to AGI (Theses)

- AGI progress is framed as 50/50 scaling and innovation (compute + breakthroughs). [Unverified]
- “Jagged intelligence” highlighted: strong in some domains, weak in others; consistency and reasoning depth framed as missing. [Unverified]

## World Models and Simulation

- World models/simulations (e.g., Genie) are framed as essential for AGI to capture spatial dynamics and causality beyond language. [Unverified]
- Simulations are framed as enabling controlled experiments across many initial conditions for complex systems. [Unverified]

## Online / Continual Learning

- Online and continual learning from real-world experience framed as critical missing pieces for AGI. [Unverified]

## Societal Impact (Theses)

- AGI revolution framed as faster/larger than industrial revolution; may require new social/economic institutions (e.g., UBI-like distribution). [Unverified]
- International collaboration framed as urgent but difficult. [Unverified]
