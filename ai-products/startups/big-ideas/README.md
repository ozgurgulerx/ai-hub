# Big Ideas (AI Startups)

This folder captures **visionary theses** and “big ideas” that might shape new AI companies and product categories.

## How to Use

- Keep each idea short, opinionated, and falsifiable.
- Prefer linking to concrete evidence (papers, benchmarks, customer stories) when available.
- If an idea is speculative, label it as **Speculative**.
- Link from each idea to startups that implement it (and back from startup entries to the idea).

## Template (copy/paste)

Create `ai-startups/big-ideas/<slug>.md`:

- **Idea**:
- **Why now**:
- **What changes**:
- **What has to be true**:
- **Failure modes**:
- **Signals to watch**:
- **Startups**:
- **References**:
