## Market Opportunity and Pricing (Claims)

- AI software is framed as replacing $1 “tasks” (labor) rather than only IT spend, expanding the market opportunity beyond traditional software budgets. [Unverified]
- “Goldilocks pricing”: low-impact software is cut first; high-impact software is more defensible but also more competitively contested. [Unverified]
- Outcome-based pricing is framed as more defensible than per-seat pricing because seats are easy to cut; pricing model is framed as a moat. [Unverified]
- AI is framed as enabling much higher pricing for “feature-like” functionality because it delivers labor replacement. [Unverified]

## Defensibility Mechanisms (Core Thesis)

- AI is framed as differentiation, not defensibility; moats come from owning the end workflow, being system of record, network effects, and embedding in operations. [Unverified]
- Data network effects are framed as emerging only at mega-scale (“gravity”), but hard to reach due to competitors and ease of building alternatives. [Unverified]
- “Slope vs position” thesis: trajectory/momentum matters more than current position; poor slope leads to being outcompeted. [Unverified]

## Founder and Market Dynamics

- Founders are framed as increasingly technical/AI-fluent but less industry-native; recommendation: hire industry experts early to understand workflow impacts. [Unverified]
- Greenfield markets are framed as requiring patient entrepreneurs and high rates of new company creation. [Unverified]
- Enterprise motion is framed as consultative: bespoke integrations for lighthouse customers, then expand; only a few survive charging premium prices. [Unverified]

## Industry-Specific Applications (Examples)

- Legal AI: contingency-fee firms can scale clients with efficiency gains (unlike billable-hour dynamics). [Unverified]
- “Salient” is referenced as an example: multilingual voice agents for auto loan servicing with higher collection rates than humans. [Unverified]

## Competitive Landscape

- Consolidation framing: many startups building the same thing will die; survivors charge premium prices. [Unverified]
- Incumbents are framed as advantaged because they own workflows/systems of record and can add AI features. [Unverified]
