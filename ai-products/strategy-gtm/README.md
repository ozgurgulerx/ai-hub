**[AI Product Strategy Comprehensive Guide](../../docs/ai-products/strategy-gtm/AI-product-strategy-comprehensive-guide.md)** — Complete reference covering:

- Product philosophy (latent demand, unshipping, speed + quality)
- Go-to-market strategy (category creation, PLG, virality)
- Vertical AI success (domain experts, review dashboards, prompting vs fine-tuning)
- Enterprise & document automation (HITL-first, true automation rate, ontologies)
- Production monitoring & evaluation (signals + intents, Trellis framework)
- AI verification (last mile problem, judge agents, rubrics)
- Platform strategy (compound returns, specialization)
- Customer service & legal AI patterns
- Human-centric AI design (memory, empowerment)
- Hiring & team building

## Key Themes

| Theme | Core Insight |
|-------|--------------|
| **PMF Treadmill** | Re-find product-market fit every ~3 months as models improve |
| **Domain Experts** | Tight expert → eval → improvement loops beat model chasing |
| **Production Reality** | Offline evals are unit tests; production signals reveal real issues |
| **Distribution** | Word of mouth before ads is the true PMF signal |
| **Verification** | The last mile problem—converting outputs to trustworthy quality signals |
