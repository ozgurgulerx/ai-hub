# AI Products & Product-Led GTM

This repository focuses on building AI-powered products and taking them to market with a product-led go-to-market (GTM) approach.

## Focus Areas
- AI product strategy and positioning
- Product-led growth (PLG) and GTM playbooks
- User onboarding, activation, and retention for AI products
- Pricing, packaging, and monetization for AI capabilities
- Experimentation frameworks and metrics

## Emerging Shift: Agent-Readable Architecture

Software design is transitioning from human-first to agent-readable architecture, prioritizing machine legibility over visual hierarchy and human aesthetics, requiring developers to optimize interfaces for AI insight extraction rather than human attention and engagement.

Agent-centric content creation optimizes for machine parsing and understanding rather than human readability, creating risk of low-quality, high-volume content that serves AI consumption but may degrade human experience and information quality.
