## Growth Strategy Shift (Innovation > Optimization)

- Lovable is described as reaching $200M ARR in under 1 year with 100 employees; growth playbook reframed as 95% innovation, 5% optimization. [Unverified]
- Traditional growth tactics are described as 60–70% obsolete because market moves too fast; optimization completes after the advantage expires. [Unverified]
- “PMF treadmill” framing: AI companies must re-find PMF every ~3 months due to frequent model releases and shifting expectations. [Unverified]
- Shipping frequency (daily/multiple times per day) is described as creating market noise and re-engagement, becoming part of retention. [Unverified]

## Distribution and Marketing

- “Free” is described as the most powerful growth lever (supercharged PLG) by removing monetization friction. [Unverified]
- Influencer marketing is described as higher ROI than paid social; “build in public” on social platforms emphasized. [Unverified]
- Distributing AI credits at events/hackathons is described as a marketing cost to lower barriers and drive virality. [Unverified]

## Product and UX

- “Minimum Lovable Product” reframes MVP: delight-first experiences that users want to share. [Unverified]
- Retention focus is described as engagement/usage (not paid retention), optimizing monetization later. [Unverified]
- “Vibe coder” role is described as blending technical and non-technical skills to push velocity. [Unverified]

## Community and Org

- Large Discord community is described as part of retention (community managers, ambassadors). [Unverified]
- Hiring is described as prioritizing high-agency/autonomous talent comfortable with chaos. [Unverified]
- Growth teams shift from activation tweaks to building core product capabilities (integrations, voice, agent workflows). [Unverified]
