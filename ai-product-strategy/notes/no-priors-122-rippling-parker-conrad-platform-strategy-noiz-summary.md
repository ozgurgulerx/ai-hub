## Platform Architecture & Business Strategy

- Platform investment is described as compounding: 35× ROI because shared capabilities (permissions, analytics, workflow automation) benefit 35+ apps. [Unverified]
- Org split described: 80% of a 1000+ eng team maintains platform + existing apps; new products built by 5–7 engineers per project (maintenance dominates). [Unverified]
- Platform/app tension described: app teams want to disconnect from shared infra, but that sacrifices multiplicative returns. [Unverified]

## Leadership and Org Design

- App leaders are framed as “former founders” owning domains holistically (product, roadmap, marketing, sales, competition), not just engineering. [Unverified]
- Strong teams are described as having order-of-magnitude output differences by bridging gaps to ambitious goals. [Unverified]
- CEO advice: reject forced A/B tradeoffs; demand creative solutions for A and B. [Unverified]

## AI and Future of Software

- Skepticism claim: AI coding assistants haven’t meaningfully improved efficiency in large orgs; AI may increase software demand, requiring more engineers. [Unverified]
- Governance/permissions/data pipelines are framed as harder than building AI apps; agents need to inherit user permissions and org context. [Unverified]
- AI cost reduction may drive verticalized core software, but edge cases remain hard (payroll correctness framing). [Unverified]

## Market Dynamics

- AI is framed as more centralizing than cloud; raises bar for standalone apps and pushes integration into comprehensive platforms. [Unverified]
