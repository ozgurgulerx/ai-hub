## Category Creation & Go-to-Market

- Modern Treasury is described as creating a category in payment operations by publicly discussing common operational challenges that were not previously framed as a software category. [Unverified]
- The company is described as prioritizing marketing hires before sales to establish thought leadership and help customers understand problems they didn’t yet associate with a software solution. [Unverified]
- Feature requests are described as noisy early, then converging into repeating patterns across prospects, increasing confidence that building the most-requested features generalizes. [Unverified]

## MVP & Early Product Development

- MVP timeline described: ~10–12 weeks to build, including:
  - an API for initiating/reconciling payments (ACH, wire),
  - a dashboard for visibility,
  - bank integration. [Unverified]
- Additional timeline described: ~5 months post-YC to go live with the first customer. [Unverified]
- Early-stage guidance: spend more time on product/usability than pricing; build something customers love before monetization tuning. [Unverified]
- Founders are described as continuing customer research post-MVP to understand variability in payment operations and feed product direction. [Unverified]

## Customer Acquisition & Trust Building

- First customers are described as coming via personal relationships, warm intros, and targeted cold outreach to companies with known payment pain. [Unverified]
- Target segment described: seed/Series A startups without established finance teams (lower adoption friction). [Unverified]
- First customer described: a healthcare benefits startup needing sophisticated money movement from day one due to complex reconciliation and allocations across multiple accounts. [Unverified]
- Trust challenge: for money-movement infra, trust is described as earned via relationships and conviction in long-term vision (early), not only technical claims. [Unverified]

## Scaling to Enterprise Relationships

- As customers get larger, trust is described as becoming quantifiable: support quality, SLAs, and disaster recovery posture. [Unverified]
- Larger customers introduce more stakeholders and decision complexity, increasing relationship-management burden. [Unverified]

## Operating Model (Founders)

- Founders are described as taking primary/secondary ownership across functions (e.g., bank relationships, technical work) to speed decisions and ensure accountability. [Unverified]
