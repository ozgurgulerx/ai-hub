## Product Evolution (Products as Organisms)

- Products are framed as “living entities” that improve through interactions.
- Tuning for outcomes (price/performance/quality) is framed as the new company IP.
- Post-training investment is predicted to surpass pre-training; claim: optimizing existing models becomes more efficient after ~30B parameters (verify).

## Interface + Workflow Shifts

- “Agent companies”: software runs more in the background with less GUI as agents interact and evolve automatically (as framed).
- “Code-native interfaces” are described as replacing GUIs, enabling agents to read/compose code at scale.
- Continuous feedback and observability are emphasized as cultural fundamentals, blurring traditional functional boundaries.

## Org Transformation

- “Org chart becomes the work chart” as agents perform tasks; task routing/work assignment/fine-tuning based on performance + observability (as described).
- Exponential demand for productivity/output is predicted as marginal costs approach zero (as framed).

## Strategy + Planning

- A “seasons” framework is described for planning and adaptation (semesters of planning, loose quarterly OKRs, squad goals).
- Current season described as “rise of agents”; next season framed as fine-tuning agents with alignment, accountability, observability, and evaluation.

## Model Diversity + Product Technique

- Model diversity is emphasized: different models for latency, thinking time, and quick retrieval.
- Reinforcement learning (RL) is framed as a key product technique for adapting/tuning models to outcomes.
