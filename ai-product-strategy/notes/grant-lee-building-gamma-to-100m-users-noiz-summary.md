## Growth Strategy (As Described)

- Gamma is described as reaching 100M users and $100M ARR without paid advertising, driven by organic virality and a “dead simple” create/share UX. [Unverified]
- Signups are described as accelerating from 60k in 8 months to 50k/day after optimizing the first 30 seconds of UX for 3–4 months pre-launch. [Unverified]
- 25% of a 7-person team is described as dedicated to design and white-glove onboarding of influencers, treating them as team extensions. [Unverified]
- “Word of mouth before ads” is framed as the key signal of PMF; don’t confuse paid growth with PMF. [Unverified]

## Product Differentiation

- Differentiation strategy: be fundamentally different from PowerPoint (not “better”), enabling fast content creation for non-designers. [Unverified]
- AI timing: ignored AI for first two years; later orchestrated multiple AI models in product ways labs can’t replicate (claim). [Unverified]
- Interaction shift: “Agent 3.0” described as a design partner that closes the loop from outline to feedback. [Unverified]

## B2B Strategy

- Enter B2B after consumer love creates internal champions and demand signals. [Unverified]
- Integrations (CRMs/sales intel) described as enabling personalized presentations for clients. [Unverified]
- Monetization timing: launch pricing after strong PMF to avoid leaving money on the table; went from 12 months runway to profitable in 3 months (claim). [Unverified]

## Team, Brand, Culture

- “Hire painfully slowly” mantra; keep bar high under growth. [Unverified]
- Brand principle “don’t be boring” framed as driving playful content and founder involvement. [Unverified]
