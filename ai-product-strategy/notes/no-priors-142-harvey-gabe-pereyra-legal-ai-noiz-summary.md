Status: **To verify**

## Business Model & Positioning (As Described)

- Harvey is described as scaling to 1,000 customers and growing headcount rapidly by enabling law firms rather than competing with them, avoiding conflicts of interest. [Unverified]
- Strategy is framed as focusing on firm-level profitability and team productivity (workflow/staffing/pricing per practice area) rather than individual efficiency. [Unverified]
- Thesis: making every law firm AI-first is framed as larger than building a single AI-first law firm (conflict constraints). [Unverified]

## Technical Architecture and Constraints (Claims)

- Harvey is described as deploying agents for complex legal tasks (fund formation, M&A), working over long-form docs and producing structured outputs. [Unverified]
- Biggest technical challenge framed as secure collaboration and data sharing across multiple professional service providers on sensitive workstreams. [Unverified]
- Breakthrough feature described: document upload with accurate citations, demonstrating verifiability. [Unverified]

## Data and Evaluation Challenges

- Legal work framed as long-form generation with hard-to-verify reward functions; partner edits/feedback loops are described as crucial data. [Unverified]
- Public merger data lacks expert reasoning traces/decision processes, limiting training on “why” structuring decisions matter. [Unverified]

## Future of Legal Practice (Theses)

- Future framed as fewer associates; partners remain critical for strategy, client interface, and risk management. [Unverified]
- Transition from individual AI to organizational AI systems compared to design evolution (e.g., collaborative tools) with AI as another productivity layer. [Unverified]
