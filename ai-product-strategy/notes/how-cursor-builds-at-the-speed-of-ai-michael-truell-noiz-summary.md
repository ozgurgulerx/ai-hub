## Strategic Product Decisions

- Cursor is described as explicitly building for power users (not “democratization”), choosing to own the editor surface rather than plugins. [Unverified]
- Early pivot described: choose programming over CAD due to founder-market fit and cold-start dynamics; ship to daily-driver in ~2 weeks. [Unverified]
- Vendor dynamics: Cursor is described as becoming a high share of provider revenue; required multi-cloud infra and token management to secure capacity. [Unverified]

## Operational Execution

- Monthly investor updates from day one are described as a commitment device for focus/accountability. [Unverified]
- Founders delayed model work to first build the editor surface + AI bundle. [Unverified]

## Hiring and Talent

- Interview process described: two-day onsite with a frozen codebase to test end-to-end skills (codebase navigation, agentic behavior, product sense). [Unverified]
- Aggressive recruiting described (traveling to candidates, long-cycle follow-up). [Unverified]

## Growth and Scaling

- Rapid scaling described as stressing Kubernetes; “Cursor’s Down” iPad anecdote. [Unverified]

## Product Expansion

- Expansion beyond editor into team collaboration tools is described as strategic/necessary. [Unverified]
- M&A strategy described as acquiring teams and complementary products. [Unverified]
