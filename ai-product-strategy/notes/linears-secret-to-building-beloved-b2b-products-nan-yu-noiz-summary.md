## Product Development Philosophy

- Build a first version as a “best guess” to validate assumptions; don’t aim for perfection.
- Emphasize speed + quality by targeting a workable solution quickly and iterating.
- Solve core user problems before broad release.

## User-Centric Approach

- Prioritize the individual contributor (IC) user over middle managers.
- Tie requests to specific users with real workflows/use cases.
- Look for emotional pain points and build features that remove friction/negative feelings.

## Feature Management + Creativity

- Maintain a backlog of potential product areas and re-evaluate using research/data.
- Explore “extreme” design variants across traits (fast/unsafe vs slow/safe) to find an optimal balance.

## Product Management Strategies

- PMs connect builders (engineering/design) with sellers (sales/marketing), shaping messaging and commercial outcomes.
- Treat deadlines as P0; cut scope to ship on time when needed.

## Team and Talent

- Value builders who can find workable solutions without getting blocked by design.
- Avoid customization that risks bloat and reduces engagement (as framed).
